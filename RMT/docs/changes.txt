Changes in RMT 1.28
-------------------

- Recognition of any changes (indicated by '*' mark after filename in title bar)
  and dialog with "Save current changes?" question (when new song, load song,
  import song and/or when tracker goes to exit).
- Hotkey for "Cursor go to the track speed column" changed to Control+Z.
  (There is also new menu item "Track - Cursor go to the speed column".)
- Control+S is new hotkey for "File - Save" from now.
  (If this hotkey is used, messagebox with query "Save song to file '...'?"
  appears and you have to confirm your request. Also you can disable this
  query messagebox in Config dialog (menu View - Configuration)).
- New hotkey Control+L for "File - Load...".
- New hotkey ScrollLock for autofollow mode turn on/off.
- Sound click when "Undo" hotkey is pressed but undo is not possible.
- Handling of track events with zero volume during manual step replaying
  (by Shift+/Control+/Enter hotkey) corrected.
- Vertical line separator added between left and right tracks.
- View menu items settings are stored to rmt.ini configuration file.
- New functions in menu Instrument - submenu Paste special:
  * Volume envelopes and Envelope parameters only
  * Insert Volume envelopes and Envelope parameters to cursor position
    (Note: Cursor has to be in some column of volume or parameters envelope.)
  * Volume R to L envelope only
  * Volume L to R envelope only
- New function in menu "Song - Song change maximal length of tracks".
  It also compute effective maximal length value for current song.
  Warning: All tracks can be prolonged or truncated!
  (Note: Computing and setting of effective maximal length is also added
   to function "Song - All size optimizations".)
- Routine in exported XEX Atari executable msx file improved.
  Now it works well on PAL/NTSC computers and playing speed
  is adjusted automatically to 50Hz on PAL and also on NTSC systems.
  (If configuration is set to NTSC system speed, then 60Hz.
   Note: RMT and SAP files doesn't contain any NTSC type, so playing speed 60Hz
   is supported only in exported XEX Atari executable msx files.)
- NumLock handling improved (I hope ;-)).
- Other small corrections and bugfixes. 

RMT routine changes
- New variable RMTSFXVOLUME for sfx volume settings (volume * 16).
  Example "/asm_src/sfx/sfx.a65" has been modified.
  (suggested by Tebe)

Changes in RMT 1.25
-------------------

- Maximal length of instrument envelope increased to 48 (ELEN=$01..$30).
  Overall size (decadic value in bytes) of Atari instrument data there is shown.
  (Note: One instrument with full envelope and note/frq table has size 188 bytes.)
  Warning: If you will load instrument files with longer envelope than 32
  (or RMT modules containing such instruments) to older RMT tracker program versions,
  it can cause totally unpredictable results (inclusive of program crash).
  Please, use the latest RMT tracker program versions always to avoid this kind of problems.
  Previous Atari RMT player programs and Atari RMT assembler player routines
  are working well all along (there isn't problem with longer instrument envelope).
- Cursor background color was improved (better visibility). (suggested by PG)
- menu Instrument - Info about using of actual instrument - Track listing
  info added and volume range detection improved (standalone volume lines are processed too).

  * "From/To instrument" ranges comboboxes.
  * "One instrument only" checkbox.
  * "Changes only in current track" checkbox. (suggested by PG)
  * "Default ranges" button.
  * "All instruments" button.
  * "The same instrument range" checkbox.
  Change process improved for standalone volume lines.
- Mouse control of turn on/off the channels in song head area (L1-R4 title)
  * LeftMouseButton ... turn on/off relevant channel.
  * RightMouseButton ... solo play of relevant channel / turn on all channels.
  (suggested by PG)
- New features in Config dialog (menu View - Configuration):
  * Remembering octaves and volumes for each instrument separately
    (default is on). (suggested by LiSU)
    Note: Instruments' octaves and volumes are also stored to RMW working file.
  * "Paths..." button.
    There is possible to define default paths for loading and saving of songs,
    instruments and tracks. Each path type is remembered separately.
    (suggested by LiSU & Miker)
- Some improvements in block effect/tool (menu Block - Effect/tools or Control+F)
  for "Echo" effect:
  Fade out level can be defined as percentage value for proportional volume degression
  or as integer value for linear volume substraction.
  Support for echo ending on minimal volume. (suggested by LiSU)
- Some configuration parameters are stored to RMW working file.
- Suppression of Atari "Attract mode" in exported "XEX Atari executable msx".
- Other internal improvements and small bugfixes.

- Bookmark support - toolbar button "Play from bookmark".
  (Button is disabled if bookmark is not set up).
  New hotkeys:
  * Control+F1 ... Set bookmark to the current position
    (also current beat speed is stored).
  * F1 ... Play song from the bookmark position (only if bookmark is set up)
    include beat speed initialization by stored bookmark beat speed.
  * Shift+F1 ... Similar to F1, but with autofollow of the currently played position.
  Note: If insert/delete songline operations are performed,
  bookmark is moved down/up automatically.
- Other small corrections and bugfixes.

RMT routine changes
- New speed/size optimalization options supported:
  FEAT_EFFECTVIBRATO (it can save 65 bytes and quite a lot of CPU cycles).

- RMT routine is 40 bytes shorter now and quicker about 100-200 CPU cycles.


Changes in RMT 1.15
-------------------

- Quadruple instrument speed allowed also for 8 tracks STEREO modules.
- .rmt (.txt,.rmw) filename can be used as the commandline parameter
  for the automatic loading of this file after start of the RMT tracker.
  (It's recommended to make association for "rmt" extension to run RMT tracker.)
- Show Play time counter (from 00.0 sec to 9:59 minutes).
  (default is on, turn off by menu View - Play time counter)
- Menu Track:
  * Info about using of actual track.
  * Renumber all tracks (2 types of ordering).
  * Clear all tracks unused in song.
- Menu Instrument:
  * Renumber all instruments (3 types of ordering).
  * Clear all unused instruments.
- Two tracks functions moved from Song menu to Track menu (Search and rebuild wise 
  loops in all tracks, Expand loops in all tracks).
- Size optimization function (menu Song - All size optimizations) perform also
  clearing of all unused instruments and renumbering of all tracks and instruments now.
  (So there can be a bit better result of size optimization thanks to removing unused
  instruments and removing empty gaps after deleting of unused tracks and instruments.)
- Preserve last "From address" value in export of stripped RMT file dialog.

RMT routine changes
- Several improvements of RMT Atari assembler routine - it is 22 bytes shorter now
  and quicker about 50-150 CPU cycles.
- New speed/size optimalization options FEAT_VOLUMEMIN and FEAT_TABLEGO supported 
  and optimalization for FEAT_AUDCTLMANUALSET improved.
  (Coders, you have to use new rmtplayr.a65 and rmt_feat.a65)
- New mono/stereo compile modes. There is variable STEREOMODE (instead of previous
  variable STEREO8T) with the following values:
  STEREOMODE equ M  ;M=0 => compile RMTplayer for 4 tracks mono
                    ;M=1 => compile RMTplayer for 8 tracks stereo
                    ;M=2 => compile RMTplayer for 4 tracks stereo L1 R2 R3 L4
                    ;M=3 => compile RMTplayer for 4 tracks stereo L1 L2 R3 R4
  * Note: If RMTplayer routine compiled with STEREOMODE 2 or 3 is used on Atari computer 
    without STEREO upgrade, then standard 1 POKEY mono music will be played.
    It exploit POKEY memory area mirroring - there isn't used any "stereo detection" method!

Bugfixes
- Bug in rmtplayr.a65 initialization part if nonzero "starting song line position"
  was used. (This problem occured in some cases only.)
- Buffer overflow error with export of stripped RMT file for too high address.
- Other small corrections and bugfixes.


Changes in RMT 1.14
-------------------

- Menu Project: Import...
  * Support for importing of classic ProTracker MOD format with 31 samples, 
    4 or 8 channels (also modules with 5, 6, 7 channels), as well as old 
    ProTracker 15 samples 4 channels MOD modules.
    After import there is need of manual adjustment (tones tuning and distortions) 
    of all instruments at first!!! Volume envelopes and loops are prepared 
    in accordance with real samples in MOD module.
  * Support for importing of Atari XE/XL TMC Theta Music Composer modules.
    TMC instruments are imitated automatically by RMT instruments if it is possible.
    There can be need of manually corrections!!! 
    (Disclaimer: Some TMC effects may be totally wrong, sorry.)

Changes in RMT beta 1.02
------------------------

Since the RMT beta 1.02 version all the parts based on GPL sources are totally removed
from the RMT project (i.e. Pokey sound emulation and Atari 6502 processor emulation)
and these aren't a part of RMT henceforth. 

Description of dynamic DLL functions for standalone Pokey and 6502 emulation 
is specified in the readme.txt file. If you run RMT without this way described DLLs
(sa_pokey.dll, sa_c6502.dll), RMT will work, but there won't be any Pokey sound output
and Atari sound routines won't be executed.

Improvements
- Use the hardware sound buffer if possible (instead of software sound buffer).
- Initialize the file load directory to program location.
- Block toolbar is showed by default.
- Much more summary informations in the About box.
- Text parameters editing was changed a bit. Because of ShiftKey is used for playing
  the notes, You have to press the CapsLock key for switch to "normal" ShiftKey behaviour
  (i.e. ShiftKey+Key for entering uppercase and other (!@#$%^&*()_+:"<>?|) characters).
  CapsLock mode is turned off automatically when text editing is over by pressing the Tab key
  or Enter key.
- CapsLock state indication in the status bar ("CAP").
- Reinit also RMT Atari sound routines when the Pause key is pressed.
- Functions for turn on/off the sound channels (tracks):
  * Control+ 1-8 ...turn on/off the sound channel (track) 1-8.
  * Control+ 9 ...turn on all the channels (tracks).
  * Control+ 0 ...turn off all the channels (tracks).
  * Control+ BackQuote ...turn on/off the active sound channel (track).
  * Shift+ BackQuote ...negation of turned on/off sound channels (tracks).
  * BackQuote ...solo play of active sound channel (track) / turn on all channels (tracks).
  Note: Muted sound channels are indicated by gray color of track title and volume
  analyzer scope.
- Status bar tool tips and short flying help messages completed.
- Other internal improvements.

TrackEdit
- Mouse control of turn on/off the channels (tracks) - it's indicated by mouse cursor design
  change to "hand with title 'on/off'":
  * LeftMouseButton ... turn on/off relevant channel (track).
  * RightMouseButton ... solo play of relevant channel (track) / turn on all channels (tracks).

InstrumentEdit
- Drawing of envelope volume curve by mouse - it's indicated by mouse cursor design 
  change to "pen with title 'volume'":
  * LeftMouseButton ... draw volume curve.
  * RightMouseButton ... set volume to zero value.

Bugfixes
- Playing the block area.
- Inserting and deleting song lines from track edit when "go to line" is active.
- Other internal corrections.


Changes in RMT beta 1.01
------------------------

All modes
- Set the octave up-down hotkeys changed from Shift+up,down to Shift+page_up,page_down
  (it works now in TrackEdit and InstrumentEdit only).
- Correction of bug with instrument copy/paste.

TrackEdit
- No more set number of the track by Control+0-9A-F keys.
- Hotkey changed: Control+I - insert new line into the song.
- Hotkey changed: Control+U - delete the current line from the song.
- Show title "EMPTY" for empty tracks.
- Shift+up,down,home,end - the block select functions.
- Control+A - select all data in the track (from the begin to the end of the track).
- Control+Insert,Control+C - copy block to clipboard.
- Shift+Insert,Control+V - paste data from clipboard.
- If the block is selected and paste function is used, then data from clipboard is placed into the block select area only.
- If the block is selected, then Delete key will delete data inside the block area.
- If the block is selected, then Control+X key will cut data inside the block area.
- New toolbar for block data modifications: menu View - Block toolbar. All this modify functions are available also by hotkeys.
- Block data modification hotkeys (the block must be selected at first):
  * Shift+Control+A switch between block modify mode all / current instrument only.
  * Shift+Control+page_up,page_down do transpose up,down notes in the block (by semitones).
  * Shift+Control+left,right do change of instrument numbers in the block.
  * Shift+Control+Num-,Num+ do change of volumes in the block.
  Note transpositions, instrument changes and volume changes are indicated in window statusbar at the bottom.
- If the block is selected:
  * Enter key will play the lines inside the block around.
  * Home or End key set the cursor to the first or the last line in the block.
  * Control+B will restore the block data changed by modification functions from the backup (backup is created when the block is getting start to select and destroyed when the block is deselected).
  * Control+F4 will start cyclic playing of the part from the top to the bottom of selected block area.

Operation manual
- All this changes included to operation manual (see the rmt_en.htm, rmt_cz.htm).
